1. Model Segmentation: The entire neural network model is divided into several segments. Each segment can be seen as a subset of consecutive layers of the model.

2. Device Allocation: Each segment of the model is assigned to a different device. This way, multiple devices can be used to host the entire model, with each device responsible for computing the forward and backward passes of its assigned segment.

3. Mini-batch Splitting: The input data (mini-batch) is also split into smaller micro-batches. These micro-batches are then fed sequentially into the pipeline.

4. Sequential Processing of Micro-batches: The first micro-batch is fed into the first segment. Once the first device starts processing the first micro-batch, it can immediately pass its output to the second segment/device, and then start processing the second micro-batch. This process continues, creating a "pipeline" of operations across devices.

5. Parallel Computation: After the initial fill time (the time it takes to get all segments working on something), each device is continuously working on different micro-batches at different stages of processing (forward pass, backward pass). This parallelism increases the utilization of each device and speeds up the training process.

**Challenges and Considerations**

- Communication Overhead: The need to pass data between devices can introduce communication overhead, especially if the devices are not closely interconnected.

- Balancing Load: It's crucial to divide the model into segments in a way that balances the computational load across all devices to avoid bottlenecks.

- Bubble Time: There's an inherent inefficiency called "bubble time" or "pipeline bubble," which is the idle time when some devices are waiting for data to process. Optimizing the size of micro-batches and the number of segments can help minimize this effect.
