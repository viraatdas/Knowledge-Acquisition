# Central Dogma

Sandra: *"Got that central dogma in me"*

### DNA Structure
- **Single Circular Chromosome** (prokaryotic DNA structure, typically seen in bacteria and archaea)

- In contrast to eukaryotic cells (which have multiple linear chromosomes), prokaryotes feature a more streamlined and efficient genome architecture with fewer regulatory elements.

## Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT)
- The process by which organisms transfer genetic material between one another, outside of traditional reproduction (vertical transmission).
- Plays a critical role in bacterial evolution, contributing to the spread of antibiotic resistance, virulence factors, and metabolic pathways.

### 1. Vertical Transmission
- Genes are passed from parent to offspring through standard reproduction.

### 2. Horizontal Transmission
- Genes are transferred between organisms, potentially across species barriers.

#### Mechanisms of Horizontal Transmission:
1. **Conjugation**: Transfer via **sex pilus**  
   - [GOOD] for bacteria
   - A direct cell-to-cell contact is established, allowing the exchange of plasmids (extrachromosomal DNA).  
   - **F-plasmid**: Contains genes necessary for the formation of the sex pilus.  
   - Important for spreading antibiotic resistance genes.

2. **Transduction**: Transfer via **bacteriophages** (viruses that infect bacteria)  
   - [BAD] for bacteria
   - Bacteriophages can accidentally package bacterial DNA and transfer it to other bacteria during infection.
   - There are two types:
     - **Generalized Transduction**: Random bacterial DNA is packaged into the viral particle.
     - **Specialized Transduction**: Only specific bacterial genes adjacent to the viral integration site are transferred.
   - This can introduce foreign DNA that disrupts bacterial function or integrates into the host genome, potentially altering behavior or killing the bacteria.

3. **Transformation**: Uptake of **naked DNA** (often plasmids) from the environment  
   - [GOOD] for bacteria
   - Bacteria take up DNA fragments or plasmids from their surroundings and incorporate them into their genome.
   - Natural competence (ability to uptake DNA) varies across species. In lab settings, methods to induce competence include:
     1. **Heat shock**: Involves exposing bacteria to cold followed by rapid warming, opening pores in the membrane to allow DNA uptake.
     2. **Electroporation**: Uses electric pulses to create temporary pores in the membrane for plasmid insertion.
   - **Application**: Transformation is widely used in genetic engineering to introduce desired traits or genes into bacterial hosts.

### Evolutionary Conundrum
- Horizontal gene transfer challenges the traditional view of evolution as a tree-like structure of descent from a common ancestor. Instead, HGT presents a more **networked model of evolution** with genes shared between unrelated organisms.
- HGT is particularly prominent in prokaryotes, allowing rapid adaptation to changing environments (e.g., antibiotic pressure). This complicates the evolutionary tree and forces reconsideration of how traits spread across populations.

## The Restriction-Modification (RM) System
### The Immune System of Bacteria
- Bacteria have evolved sophisticated systems to defend themselves against foreign DNA, particularly from bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria).

### Components:
1. **Restriction Enzymes (REase)**
   - These enzymes cut DNA at specific recognition sites (motifs) that are usually palindromic (e.g., 5'-GAATTC-3').
   - They serve as a defense mechanism by cleaving foreign DNA (such as bacteriophage DNA), preventing infection.
   - Many restriction enzymes are named after the bacteria from which they were isolated (e.g., **EcoRI** from *E. coli*).
   
2. **Methyltransferases (MTase)**
   - Methylate the hostâ€™s own DNA at the same recognition sites targeted by restriction enzymes.
   - Methylation acts as a protective "mark," preventing the host's restriction enzymes from cutting its own DNA.
   - This system of paired restriction enzymes and methyltransferases ensures foreign DNA is destroyed while the host genome remains intact.

## Stealth-by-Engineering
- Some engineered bacterial strains can evade detection by restriction enzymes through a process termed **"Stealth-by-Engineering."**
- This is particularly useful in synthetic biology, where scientists want to insert foreign DNA into bacteria without triggering the RM system.
- Methods to evade RM systems include:
  1. **Methylation of foreign DNA**: Before introducing the DNA into bacteria, scientists can methylate it to mimic the host's natural DNA.
  2. **Synthetic redesign of DNA motifs**: Using advanced DNA synthesis platforms (such as **PacBio** and **Twist Bioscience**), specific restriction sites are modified or removed, preventing cleavage by restriction enzymes. This allows for safe integration of engineered genes into bacterial genomes.
  3. **Codon optimization**: In stealth engineering, scientists optimize codon usage (changing DNA sequences without altering the protein) to make the inserted genes resemble the host's native DNA.

- **Invisible Engineering**: 
  - This concept involves using genetic engineering techniques to modify bacteria in ways that avoid detection by their immune-like RM systems.
  - By manipulating methylation patterns and restriction enzyme recognition sites, researchers can "cloak" foreign DNA, rendering it invisible to bacterial defenses.
  - This has significant applications in **biotechnology**, including gene therapy, vaccine development, and the production of pharmaceuticals.
  
  **Example**: Engineered bacterial strains designed to produce therapeutic compounds or break down pollutants without triggering their own RM defenses.

## DNOVO Synthesis
- DNOVO refers to **de novo** (from scratch) DNA synthesis, enabling precise construction of genetic sequences without the need for a template.
- **Twist Bioscience** and other companies offer custom DNA synthesis services, allowing scientists to design and create novel genes, pathways, or even entire genomes tailored to specific functions.
  - **Applications**:
    - Production of **synthetic biology products**: biofuels, pharmaceuticals, and enzymes.
    - Creation of **genetically modified organisms** (GMOs) with improved traits (e.g., drought resistance in plants).
    - Development of **personalized medicine**: custom therapies based on individual genetic profiles.

## Invisible Engineering and the Future
- **Invisible engineering** is part of a broader trend in synthetic biology, where organisms are modified in subtle ways to achieve desired outcomes while avoiding detection by natural systems (such as immune responses or environmental stressors).
- As technologies like **CRISPR-Cas9** and **long-read sequencing (PacBio)** continue to improve, the potential for more sophisticated and stealthy genetic modifications grows.
- Ethical concerns arise as the ability to engineer life forms becomes more advanced, raising questions about how far humanity should go in manipulating the genetic code.

### Key Future Areas:
1. **Gene Therapy**: Using engineered viruses to introduce therapeutic genes into human cells without triggering immune rejection.
2. **Bioremediation**: Engineering bacteria that can detoxify pollutants without being attacked by native bacterial communities.
3. **Agriculture**: Developing crop plants with enhanced traits (yield, resistance to pests) that do not suffer from horizontal gene transfer risks or environmental interference.
