Alternating current

![[Pasted image 20240402224544.png]]

AC electricity - electron alternates by flowing forward and backwards constantly


*What is frequency?*
Refers to how many times the AC sine wave repeats per second

in North America it's 60 Hz of electricity. Sine wave repeats 60 times per second

Polarity changes 120 times per second (+ to -


Rest of the world it's 50 Hz

**Different phases**
1. Single phase
	1. Just one phase from the generator
	2. large gaps between phase
2. Three phase
	1. Have a connection to each of the three phases

	2. With this the distance between the peaks decrease and thus you can have more power
3. Split phase
