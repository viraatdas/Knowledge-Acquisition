1. [[Pressurized Water Reactors]] (PWRs):
   Reactor core is surrounded by pressurized water (coolant) that helps regulate the reaction. Fuel rods are typically made of enriched uranium (U-235) or other fissile materials.
2. [[Boiling Water Reactors]] (BWRs):
   BWR uses a boiling coolant instead of pressurized water. This is simpler and less expensive to build than a PWR, but it's not as efficient in terms of energy production. 
3. [[Gas-cooled Reactors]]
   Reactor core is surrounded by a gas (usually carbon dioxide or helium) that helps regulate the reaction. The fuel rods are typically made of enriched U-235 or other fissile materials.
4. [[Liquid-metal Fast Breeder Reactors]] (LMFBRs):
   An LMFBR uses liquid metal (typically sodium or lead) as a coolant and moderator instead of water. This design is capable of producing more energy than traditional PWRs. 
   
**Designs:**

Reactor designs can vary depending on the specific application, location, and desired performance characteristics. Some common reactor designs include:

1. **Pile Reactors:** A simple design where fuel rods are stacked vertically to form a "pile"
structure.
2. **Lattice Reactors:** A more complex design where fuel rods are arranged in a lattice pattern to
improve neutron interactions.
3. **Plasma Reactors:** A high-temperature design that uses plasma (ionized gas) as the coolant and moderator instead of water.
