1. **Query**: A query is a representation of an input element that is used to score against all keys. It can be thought of as a request or a set of features that seek to retrieve information from the values.
    
2. **Keys**: Keys are representations of all input elements that are compared against the query. The comparison is used to determine the degree of "attention" or relevance of each element in the values.
    
3. **Values**: Values are the representations of all input elements that contain the actual information that needs to be retrieved. The amount of information pulled from each value is weighted by the computed scores from the query-key comparison.
