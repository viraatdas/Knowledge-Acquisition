Raw uranium (also known as yellowcake) is primarily found in sedimentary rock formations, often
associated with other minerals such as copper, gold, and silver. Here are some of the top
uranium-producing countries and regions:

1. **Australia:** Australia is the world's largest uranium producer, accounting for around 20% of
global production. Major mines include:
	* Olympic Dam (South Australia)
	* Ranger Uranium Mine (Northern Territory)
2. **Canada:** Canada is a significant uranium producer, with mines located in:
	* Saskatchewan (McArthur River and McClean Lake mines)
	* Quebec (Strathcona and Malartic mines)
3. **Nevada** (USA): The United States has several uranium-producing states, including:
	* Nevada: The state's largest uranium mine is the Smith Valley Mine
4. **Uruguay:** Uruguay has significant uranium deposits, with major mines located in:
	* Punta de Rieles (Salto and San Mateo mines)
5. **Russia:** Russia has a long history of uranium mining, with notable deposits found in:
	* Kazakhstan (Kyzylorda region)
	* Siberia (Lake Baikal area)
6. **Namibia:** Namibia is an emerging uranium-producing country, with significant deposits found
in:
	* RÃ¶ssing mine
7. **Uzbekistan:** Uzbekistan has a number of uranium mines, including:
	* Almalyk mine


Methods:
1. [[gaseous diffusion]]: gas containing uranium hexafluroide (UF6) is passed through a series of porous membranes to separate out the lighter and heavier atoms. 
2. Liquid-liquid centrifugation: uses two different liquids to separate the isotopes based on their activity
